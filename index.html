        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">I am a researcher in the Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences at 
            the University of Tokyo. My research focuses on statistical machine learning and its application in high-stakes 
            decision-making problems. After finishing my PhD at the University of Tokyo, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher 
            at the University of Tokyo, as a project assistant professor at the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and as a 
            researcher at Nagoya University in Japan. My PhD thesis concentrated on interpretable machine learning models 
            for medical data. In addition to my academic expertise, I have extensive industry experience. 
            After earning a BSc in Physics and a BTech in Applied Physics from the University of Calcutta, India, 
            I began my professional career at TATA Consultancy Services Ltd. in Kolkata, where I worked for several years. 
            I later moved to the UK to pursue an MSc in Advanced Computing from the University of Bristol, where I embarked 
            on a new journey in academia.</p>
